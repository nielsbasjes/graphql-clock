# What is this?
This is my experimental project to learn:
- GraphQL (query + subscriptions)
- Flutter (Web, Android + Android widgets)

# What kind of data is being server and consumed?
The current time.

So no databases, external connections or other dependencies.

I chose this to really focus on the points I want to learn.

# What is in this repo?
This is 2 projects that are related:

1) A Spring-boot Graphql Server that supports subscriptions.
2) A Flutter based client that consumes this subscription and updates the screen.

# How to try this

Both project MUST be opened in your IDE as separate projects !

1) Open the graphql-server project in IntelliJ with support for Maven
2) Open the flutter-client project in Android Studio (which demands Gradle...)

# Current status?
I'm still learning ...
